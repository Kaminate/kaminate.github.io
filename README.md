## website setup
Download Hugo.exe from
https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases
(it may be under Assets-->Show all <n> assets --> hugo_<...>windows-amd64.zip)

Based off of https://therealmjp.github.io/posts/hello-hugo/


## gitattributes
Do not delete the .gitattributes file ( or this readme file )
Without the .gitattributes file, you get these kind of errors.
It has something to do with git line endings messing with checksums.

Example error:
Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource 'https://kaminate.github.io/assets/css/stylesheet.3299c596a7007118365635c056dd427dace22b7b8c1341fdef6fa6c31359ba10.css' with computed SHA-256 integrity 'vBFJ9KcqpIWNOp9xRi915YhP/oBz6p1tV2HVZj1lHiA='. The resource has been blocked.
