# 5 Color and Radiometry
https://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Color_and_Radiometry

__Radiometry__ - Study of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) propagation
__Visible light__ - EMR wavelength (Î») 380 nm - 780 nm
EMR is described by 4 radiometric quantities
- flux
- intensity
- irradiance
- radiance
Each quantity is described by a __spectral power distribution__ (SPD) function.

I think of light as a whole bunch of photons, and each photon has a wavelength associated with it. The collection of all of these photons is called the spectrum, and the SPD shows how many photons are at each wavelength.

In pbrt this defaults to the `RGBSpectrum` class in [core/spectrum.cpp](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/tree/master/src/core/spectrum.h)

XYZ Color
__tri stimulus theory__ - all SPDs can be represented for humans with 3 values, $x_\lambda$, $y_\lambda$, $z_\lambda$

{{<katex>}}
$$
x_\lambda = \int_\lambda \! S(\lambda)\, X(\lambda) \, \mathrm{d}\lambda
$$
$$
y_\lambda = \int_\lambda \! S(\lambda) \,Y(\lambda) \, \mathrm{d}\lambda
$$
$$
z_\lambda = \int_\lambda \! S(\lambda) \,Z(\lambda) \, \mathrm{d}\lambda
$$

note: the emissive SPD is given (the input)
x_\lambda y z are the outputs
