i gotta check out this granny sdk

merge handmade hero into tac,
- look at hot reloading gameplay as a dll for debugging, or statically linking as a lib for release
- look into debug having a common base memory address so that pointers stay the same between run

- create a gui launcher (...c++? python? that can build the exe, tools, content etc)

- define tac types with cl defines

- define wrapper class based off Ogre::Degree and Ogre::Radian?

- quaternions
- use xorshift instead of std mercenne twister because it's faster and still very random

- nd uses preprocess on code to convert SID(...) to an int, which can then even be used in a switch statement (runtime gen sids cannot be. ) 
- Can we do yhe same with constexpr?
- UE uses Fname, which keeps a cstr pointer in addition to the hash val
